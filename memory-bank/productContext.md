# Product Context

## Why this project exists
Planit exists to solve the problem of disorganized task and client management. It provides a centralized system to track what needs to be done, where it needs to happen (Ambiente), and for whom (Cliente).

## Problems Solved
- **Disparate Information**: Consolidates client data, activity schedules, and financial status in one place.
- **Scheduling**: Helps avoid conflicts and missed deadlines by tracking expected dates and times.
- **Financial Tracking**: Keeps track of payment status (`is_paga`) and amounts received versus expected values.
- **Context Awareness**: Links activities to specific environments, allowing for location-based or context-based planning.

## User Experience Goals
- **Clarity**: Users should easily see the status of activities (Pending, Completed, Delayed).
- **Organization**: Easy navigation between clients, their activities, and the environments they take place in.
- **Efficiency**: Quick access to reference files and client contact information.
