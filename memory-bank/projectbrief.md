# Project Brief: Planit

## Overview
Planit is a Django-based web application designed to manage activities, environments, and client information. It serves as a planning and organizational tool, likely for service providers or project managers who need to track tasks ("Atividades") within specific contexts ("Ambientes") for various customers ("Clientes").

## Core Goals
- **Activity Management**: Track specific tasks with financial details (value, received amount), scheduling (date/time), and status (Pending, Completed, Late).
- **Environment Organization**: Categorize activities by environments (e.g., rooms, locations, project types) with themes.
- **Client Management**: Maintain a registry of clients with contact details and addresses.
- **Resource Tracking**: Attach reference files to activities.

## Key Features
- Dashboard/Listing of activities.
- Detailed view of environments and their associated activities.
- Client database with address management.
- Financial tracking per activity (Value vs. Received).
